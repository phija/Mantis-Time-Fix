# Mantis-Time-Fix
Sets the time of an input field in Mantis changed by a javascript calendar or so automatically to a specified value.

To use this feature, GreaseMonkey is required. All content is provided in a simple file containing javascript code being executed by the GreaseMonkey plugin of your web browser.

Note:

* Adapt the line with "@include" to where your Mantis is located.
